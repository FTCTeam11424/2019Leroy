# Welcome
This is the Thales Academy FTC repository for the 2018-2019 competition season. Most of what's here is (or will be) documented in the wiki section of the repo. In the meantime, feel free to look at the navigation guide in our teamcode.

# Anvil 
This is the hardware class for all of our code in the 2018-2019 competition season. It uses a switch to be compatible between multiple drive trains.

# Auton 
This is code for Vuforia, in order to identify where we are on the field. This is going to be used in the final autonomous program though may not be final. 

# ClaspTeleop
This is code for the current Competition robot for this year. This code is for the West Coast drive train. It uses the hardware class Anvil.

# HoloClaspy
This is code for the holonomic robot that we use for testing. This code uses the holonomic drive train, and the hardware class Anvil. 
# HoloTeleop (Legacy) 
This is code from the previous First Tech season and is for research use only. Also used to show how far we've grown!
