# Nav Guide
Your one-stop-shop for finding your way through this mess of code.
## Anvil
Anvil is our very flexible, very open source definition-driven hardware abstraction layer. Anvil is cool because it allows us to just drop-in a new definition every time we change our robot or build a new one, and all movement functions are implemented automagically.
## Clasp
Clasp is our in-house TeleOp system written to work out-of-the-box with Anvil.
## Competition
Competition is where we keep our competition-specific (and thus non-transferable) robot code.
## Documentation
lol
## Everything else
Anything containing the term "claspy" is some (probably unnecessary) derivation of Clasp. The only useful thing in this collection is HoloClaspy, which implements Holonomic's weirdness in Clasp. Anything with "Teleop" or "Old" in the name is legacy code that really doesn't do anything useful for anyone.
